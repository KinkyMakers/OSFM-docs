## Why take on this project?
We aren't particularly excited about the shape of the commercially available sex machines, and this seems to be reflected by the number of people who own one.

Technology and culture have advanced, we want to bring thrusting toys along for the ride.

### Vision
A toy that is light and playful. That let's you connect with others. A toy that you can put in the drawer next to your magic wand. Something you want to cuddle and play with!
